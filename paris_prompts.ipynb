        "The Paris Agreement is an international treaty on climate change that was adopted in 2015.\n",
        "One of the results of the treaty is that all participating countries are required to submit a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) report every five years.\n",
        "These reports include a variety of vital information, such as the country's current greenhouse gas emissions, their goals for reducing emissions, and the policies they plan to implement to achieve these goals.\n",
        "Since these reports are written in plain text and can be hundreds of pages long, many questions are difficult to answer automatically, such as:\n",
        "*   What are the most common policies that countries are implementing to reduce emissions?\n",
        "*   Which countries are on track to meet their goals?\n",
        "*   Which countries are falling behind?\n",
        "*   What are the most common barriers to reducing emissions?\n",
        "\n",
        "One way to better understand these reports would be to use a common framework to help organize the information.\n",
        "The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) framework aims to provide a set of 17 climate goals (e.g. \"Affordable and Clean Energy\") with even more subgoals (or targets) that can be used to organize the information in the NDC reports.\n",
        "\n",
        "Climate Watch, is a project by the World Resources Institute that has manually aligned the unstructured texts of the Nationally Determined Contribution reports to the semi-structured Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) framework.\\footnote{https://www.climatewatchdata.org/}\n",
        "By doing so, Climate Watch allows for different stakeholders to more easily compare progress across countries and identify which areas need financing, education, policy changes or other resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, we will build a prompt-based classifier and use this dataset to evaluate the performance of the classifier.\n",
        "Since, new documents are being updated, a tool that can automatically align NDC reports to the SDG framework would save a lot of time and effort."

        "- Whichever is higher is the label we choose.\n",
