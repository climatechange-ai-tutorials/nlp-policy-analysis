Although the reports have got bigger - involving more authors, comprising more pages, and containing more references - this has not kept pace with the growth in the literature. With the IPCC citing an increasingly small proportion of available relevant literature, the question of what they cite and how this is selected becomes ever more important.\n",

        "Evidence synthesis ([overview](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres/centre-evaluation/evidence-synthesis)) describes a suite of formal methods for selecting and assessing evidence on a research question. These are most frequently used in the medical domain, where important decisions with life-or-death outcomes are rarely made based on single studies, or on \"normal\" literature reviews (where a single expert or experts select and summarise a literature with no formal procedures for how evidence is selected or assessed).\n",

        "\n",
        "Many processes in evidence synthesis, such as screening potentially relevant studies, or coding studies according to the type of evidence they provide, are repetitive and time consuming. As the number of papers grows, these processes present larger and larger challenges to the goal of producing comprehensive assessments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Repetitive and time consuming tasks are exactly those where machine-learning can be helpful. Research is mostly recorded in written texts, so that means the ML tools we are looking for come from the area of Natural Language Processing (NLP).\n",
        "\n",
        "So far the uses of ML in evidence synthesis are:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Identifying relevant studies**: A simple binary classifier can be trained on human screened data (studies labelled with 0, or 1 for relevant) to predict whether documents without labels will be relevant or not\n",
        "- **Classifying studies**: Machine learning can be used to give useful content labels to studies, either using\n",
        "  - **Unsupervised** methods like topic modelling, which need no human input but cannot assign to documents to predefined categories; or\n",
        "  - **Supervised** methods, where models predict the labels of unseen documents, based on the *predefined* labels assigned by humans.\n",

Ensuring national security is no longer (not only) a problem of the military security sector, but it is above all a social, socio-political and economic problem. Modern European security research, supported since 2007 [1, 2] by social grant challenges such as H2020-Security Societies [3] or DG Migration and Home Affairs-Terrorism other Security-related [3, 4], aims to: 'protect citizens, society and the economy, as well as infrastructure and services'. These objectives include the protection of critical infrastructure against intentional anthropogenic threats. In this article, we want to introduce the CI-PAC project. This project is a research project funded by the European Commission within the Terrorism and other Security-Related Risks (CIPS) Program. In the context of this article, we would like to point out the possibilities of managerial skills development not only from defined critical infrastructure sectors, but also from various economic sectors such as physical security systems designers and architects of these sites, including relevant governmental organizations, responsible for compliance and review of the Critical infrastructure protection measures [5]. \\u00a9 2019 IEEE.\",\n          \"Global climate change has local implications. Focusing on datasets from the topographically-challenging Karnali river basin in Western Nepal, this research provides an overview of hydro-climatic parameters that have been observed during 1981-2012. The spatial and temporal variability of temperature and precipitation were analyzed in the basin considering the seven available climate stations and 20 precipitation stations distributed in the basin. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall test and Sen's method were used to study the trends in climate data. Results show that the average precipitation in the basin is heterogeneous, and more of the stations trend are decreasing. The precipitation shows decreasing trend by 4.91 mm/year, i.e., around 10% on average. Though the increasing trends were observed in both minimum and maximum temperature, maximum temperature trend is higher than the minimum temperature and the maximum temperature trend during the pre-monsoon season is significantly higher (0.08 degrees C/year). River discharge and precipitation observations were analyzed to understand the rainfall-runoff relationship. The peak discharge (August) is found to be a month late than the peak precipitation (July) over the basin. Although the annual precipitation in most of the stations shows a decreasing trend, there is constant river discharge during the period 1981-2010.\",\n          \"The Greater Horn of Africa region increasingly experiences high risk of water scarcity. A combination of frequent droughts, rapid population growth and rising urbanisation has reduced streamflow and intensified water abstraction, causing water and food shortages. Estimates of future streamflow changes in the region have so far been highly uncertain and evaluations using ground-based measurements are still limited. Here, future streamflow changes are estimated using a distributed hydrological model forced with an ensemble of high-resolution climate simulations produced using the European community Earth-System Model v3.1. The simulated streamflow is evaluated using observed data from 29 stations from river basins across different climate zones in the region. Evaluation results show large sub-regional variations in the performance of simulated streamflow. The sign and magnitude of future streamflow changes vary between climate simulations and river basins, highlighting the uncertainties in the hydrologic projections. Overall, the streamflow projections indicate large (seasonal, long-term mean and extreme) streamflow decreases for all major rivers in Ethiopia and increases in the equatorial parts of the region at the end of the century. The ensemble mean shows a 10 to 25% decrease in the long-term mean flow in Ethiopia and a 10% increase in the equatorial part of the region in 2080s. Similarly, there is a substantial change in high flows in 2080s, with up to - 50% reduction in the northern and 50% increase in the equatorial parts of the region. These findings are critical because the rivers provide water supply to a rapidly changing socio-economy of the region.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2467,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Climate change impacts on groundwater storage in the Central Valley, California\",\n          \"Linkages among climate change, crop yields and Mexico-US cross-border migration\",\n          \"The impact of past management practices on tidal marsh resilience to sea level rise in the Delaware Estuary\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"seen\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.0,\n        \"min\": 1.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"INCLUDE\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.4995979175614052,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"12 - Coastal and marine Ecosystems\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.27502817346315517,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"12 - Human and managed\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.330103358496875,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"12 - Mountains, snow and ice\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.2558711160158655,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"12 - Rivers, lakes, and soil moisture\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.330103358496875,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"12 - Terrestrial ES\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.39519806756238324,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title_lcase\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2467,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"climatechangeimpactsongroundwaterstorageinthecentralvalleycalifornia\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
