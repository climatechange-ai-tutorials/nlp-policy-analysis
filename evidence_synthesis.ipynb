Although the reports have got bigger - involving more authors, comprising more pages, and containing more references - this has not kept pace with the growth in the literature.

        "Evidence synthesis ([overview](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres/centre-evaluation/evidence-synthesis)) describes a suite of formal methods for selecting and assessing evidence on a research question. These are most frequently used in the medical domain, where important decisions with life-or-death outcomes are rarely made based on single studies, or on \"normal\" literature reviews (where a single expert or experts select and summarise a literature with no formal procedures for how evidence is selected or assessed).\n",

        "\n",
        "Many processes in evidence synthesis, such as screening potentially relevant studies, or coding studies according to the type of evidence they provide, are repetitive and time consuming. As the number of papers grows, these processes present larger and larger challenges to the goal of producing comprehensive assessments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Repetitive and time consuming tasks are exactly those where machine-learning can be helpful. Research is mostly recorded in written texts, so that means the ML tools we are looking for come from the area of Natural Language Processing (NLP).\n",
        "\n",
        "So far the uses of ML in evidence synthesis are:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Identifying relevant studies**: A simple binary classifier can be trained on human screened data (studies labelled with 0, or 1 for relevant) to predict whether documents without labels will be relevant or not\n",
        "- **Classifying studies**: Machine learning can be used to give useful content labels to studies, either using\n",
        "  - **Unsupervised** methods like topic modelling, which need no human input but cannot assign to documents to predefined categories; or\n",
        "  - **Supervised** methods, where models predict the labels of unseen documents, based on the *predefined* labels assigned by humans.\n",
